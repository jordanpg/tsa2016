MELEE ATTACKS
	mx, my = mouse position
	angle aim = datan2(my - y, mx - x) - mod
		(mod is to put resulting angle in line with game maker image_angle property)

	create hitbox object with origin at player and image_angle set to angle aim
		(design hitbox objects so this works)

RANGED ATTACKS
	x, y = mouse position
	angle aim = datan2(my - y, mx - x) - mod
		(mod is to put resulting angle in line with game maker image_angle property)

	create projectile object from the player's position with image_angle set to angle aim
		speed x = projectile speed * dcos(angle aim)
		speed y = projectile speed * dsin(angle aim)
